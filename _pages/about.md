<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>

I am currently pursuing a M.Sc. at Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=woX_4AcAAAAJ'>Prof. Mengyuan Liu</a> and <a href='https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Beichen-Ding/47695170'>Prof. Beichen Ding</a>. I completed my B.Eng. in Intelligent Science and Technology from the same institution in 2023. My research interests are 2D/3D Vision and their applications, including human-related perception & analysis, video understanding & generation, and robotic vision.

During my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to lead or participate in a range of projects, including those focused on human action recognition, robotic manipulation guided by human instructions, and micro-expression generation. Recently, I am working on 1) a normalization method for multi-entity actions and 2) multi-modal alignment for multi-entity action recognition. I also try finetuning LLMs for 2D/3D Vision tasks.

Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to sharing my work and ideas with you.
