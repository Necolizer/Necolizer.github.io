<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>

I'm currently a MPhil student at Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=woX_4AcAAAAJ'>Prof. Mengyuan Liu</a> and <a href='https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Beichen-Ding/47695170'>Prof. Beichen Ding</a>. I'm also doing my internship at <a href='https://www.moonshot.cn/'>Moonshot AI</a>. I received my BEng degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2023.

My research interests recently focus on Reinforcement Learning for Agents. Previously I was working on 3D Vision and Vision-Language-Action Models. Throughout my academic journey, I have led and contributed to various projects in these domains, including those exploring multi-entity interactions and robotic manipulation guided by human instructions.

I am actively seeking opportunities for internships (late 2025) and Ph.D. programs (Fall 2026) in computer vision, machine learning, or related fields.

<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>

- MPhil, Sun Yat-sen University, expected completion: 2026
- BEng, Sun Yat-sen University, 2019-2023
