<h3><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h3>

I'm currently a Master's student at Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=woX_4AcAAAAJ'>Prof. Mengyuan Liu</a> and <a href='https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Beichen-Ding/47695170'>Prof. Beichen Ding</a>. Previously I was an intern at <a href='https://ai.quark.cn/'>Alibaba QuarkLLM</a> and <a href='https://www.moonshot.cn/'>Moonshot AI</a> RL Team. I received my BEng degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2023.

My research interests recently focus on Agentic RL and RL Post-Training. I'm also exploring Self-Play training for agents with RLVR. Previously I was working on Vision-Language-Action Models and Machine Vision.
